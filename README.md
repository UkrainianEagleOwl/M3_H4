# Linear Regression: Overfitting and Regularization

## About The Project

This project provides an exploration of overfitting in linear models, specifically within the context of linear regression. Through a series of exercises, we delve into why overfitting occurs and discover methodologies to diagnose, understand, and control it. The case study focuses on a bike rental dataset, which includes various features like weather conditions and calendar information, to predict the count of daily rentals.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/UkrainianEagleOwl/M3_H4.git
```

2. Install the required packages:
```sh
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
```

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
```sh
